Description: This package implements several algorithms to release sanitized treatment effects, sanitized confidence intervals, pvalues, and estimated standard deviation of treatment effects which satisfy (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy (DP). Additionally, it includes functions to create synthetic data using perturbed multivariate histogram methods for the treatments and covariates of confidential data from randomized control trials (RCTs). Using the perturbed histogram method for the covariates and the sanitized treatment effects, a synthetic dataset may be made, which provides some privacy-protections but does not provide approximate DP guarentees.
